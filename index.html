    <h1>Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
        If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!
        
        The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:
        
        name + " plays banjo" 
        name + " does not play banjo"
        Names given are always valid strings.
